# The html elements of concern are:
- Table rows (tr) of class `athing` have the *title* and the *rank*
- Table cells (td) of class `subtext` have the *points* and the *number of comments*

# Caveats
- Number of comments and points not displayed for some entries (ads?)
- For entries with 0 comments `discuss` appears on the web page
